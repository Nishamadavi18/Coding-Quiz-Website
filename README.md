In this tutorial, we’ll guide you through the process of building an engaging Quiz App with a built-in timer, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This application is designed to present users with a curated set of questions, each accompanied by a countdown timer, providing an interactive and time-bound quiz experience. Additionally, the app keeps track of users’ progress, creating an immersive and dynamic quiz environment. Let’s get started on creating a captivating Quiz App that combines functionality with an intuitive user interface.
First, create a Web page basic structure using HTML tags like buttons and heading for landing page, a button to Start Quiz, and  tags for heading text. Also, use divs and span for outer body structure along with relevant Class names and IDs.
Style the web page using the class names with CSS properties like font weight for text margins, padding to add space, text-align for alignment, and display type for display styling of individual elements.
In JavaScript, create a function that triggers the Start Quiz. When the user starts the quiz, they will get multiple questions, one after another. When the user validates the answers, they can move on to the next question. There are a series of questions hard-coded in the JavaScript file.
At the end, when all the questions are completed, the user will get a high score page where they can view their score.
